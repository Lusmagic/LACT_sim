# LACT_sim Module Interfaces

This document records the intended boundaries for modules that are not yet full
detector implementations.

## Event Identity

Formal output uses one event key:

```text
event_id
```

For CORSIKA/EventIO runs with `source.event_id_mode=event_array100`, LACT_sim
sets:

```text
event_id = shower_event * 100 + array_id
```

The HDF5 output stores only `event_id` in `/events/table` and `/images/index`.
Intermediate logs may still print decoded shower/array information for human
debugging, but downstream analysis should use `event_id`.

For example, original CORSIKA shower `468898` with `array_id=0` is stored as
`event_id=46889800`; with `array_id=2` it is stored as `event_id=46889802`.
Those trailing two digits are the array/core-offset stream, not an extra shower
number.

## Atmosphere

CORSIKA photons are interpreted as photons already at the telescope plane. The
atmosphere module is therefore an optional extra transmission factor, not a
second full shower propagation.

Supported first-stage configuration:

```ini
atmosphere.transmission=none
atmosphere.transmission=0.92
atmosphere.transmission=configs/atmosphere/transmission.csv
```

CSV tables use:

```text
wavelength_nm,transmission
```

For formal production, this CSV should come from the same atmospheric profile
used in the CORSIKA run, or from a clearly documented site measurement/model.
Until that source is fixed, the recommended benchmark setting is
`atmosphere.transmission=none` to avoid adding uncalibrated physics.

Atmospheric refractive-index timing is reserved but disabled by default:

```ini
atmosphere.refractive_index_model=none
atmosphere.speed_of_light_correction=false
```

Current optical-path timing uses:

```ini
propagation.speed_of_light_m_per_ns=0.299792458
```

## Obstruction

The obstruction module is intentionally input-driven. No built-in telescope
support model is distributed. Provide an external obstruction configuration
when you want to include support shadows:

```ini
obstruction.enabled=true
obstruction.mode=primitives
obstruction.primitives_csv=path/to/obstruction_primitives.csv
obstruction.check_incoming=true
obstruction.check_reflected=true
```

Primitive CSV columns:

```text
type,name,role,material_id,x0_m,y0_m,z0_m,x1_m,y1_m,z1_m,
center_x_m,center_y_m,center_z_m,radius_m,height_m,rotation_rad,sides,
half_x_m,half_y_m,half_z_m,bbox_min_*,bbox_max_*,
hole_radius_m,hole_rotation_rad,hole_sides
```

Supported primitive types:

- `cylinder`: uses `p0`, `p1`, and `radius_m`; intended for support tubes.
- `box`/`aabb`: uses `center_*_m` and `half_*_m`; optional `hole_*`
  describes a vertical regular-polygon aperture that does not block rays.
- `polygon_prism`: uses `center_*_m`, `radius_m`, `height_m`,
  `rotation_rad`, and `sides`; intended for regular camera-body prisms.

Coordinates are LACT telescope-local meters. The code can test both the
incoming segment before mirror intersection and the reflected segment from
mirror to output plane, so the shadow depends on source direction and telescope
pointing. For primitive mode, a segment with local `dir.z < 0` checks all solid
objects; a segment with local `dir.z > 0` checks only `role=support_strut`, so
camera-side bodies above the receiving plane do not incorrectly block reflected
photons on their way to the whiteboard/camera.

The legacy `obstruction.mode=mask` path still exists for diagnostic 2D masks,
but it should not be used as the formal off-axis obstruction model because a
single projected mask does not change with ray direction.

## SiPM And Electronics

The current SiPM/electronics path is an interface layer:

```text
collector photon -> SiPM PDE -> integrated pixel image
```

The active setting is:

```ini
sipm.pde=none
sipm.pde=0.35
sipm.pde=configs/efficiency/sipm_pde.csv
```

Detailed waveform, saturation, crosstalk, afterpulse, dark count, gain
fluctuation, and trigger electronics should be implemented behind this boundary
later. The HDF5 format already keeps integrated `pe`, `signal`, `photon_count`,
and timing summaries per event/telescope image.

For each collected Cherenkov photon or photon bunch, the integrated weight is
handled multiplicatively:

```text
p.e. contribution =
  CORSIKA bunch multiplicity
  * optical photon weight
  * mirror/filter/atmosphere efficiency factors
  * light-collector acceptance and reflection weight
  * sipm.pde
```

`sipm.pde` can be disabled, a constant, or a wavelength table. The current
output is an integrated p.e. image. It is not yet a waveform and it does not
model SiPM saturation, crosstalk, afterpulse, dark count, or gain fluctuations.
Legacy `electronics.pe_conversion` and `efficiency.sipm_pde` config keys are
accepted only as compatibility aliases and are mapped to the same SiPM PDE path.

For wavelength tables, duplicate wavelength rows are merged by arithmetic mean,
then linear interpolation is used. Values outside the table wavelength range are
treated as zero. Use `python/plot_efficiency_curves.py` to inspect each table and
the combined efficiency before running a full response simulation.

## NSB

The first NSB implementation is a constant-rate Poisson model:

```ini
nsb.enabled=false
nsb.model=constant_rate
nsb.rate_pe_per_ns_per_pixel=0.05
nsb.window_ns=16
nsb.seed=12345
```

It applies only to dense pixel-camera HDF5 output. The final
`/images/dense/pe` includes the NSB p.e. contribution. Use
`output.hdf5_write_components=true` to additionally write `cherenkov_pe` and
`nsb_pe`. When waveform output is enabled with `waveform.source=pe`, NSB is
sampled per waveform time bin using `rate_pe_per_ns_per_pixel *
waveform.time_bin_width_ns`; otherwise it is sampled once per pixel with
`rate_pe_per_ns_per_pixel * nsb.window_ns`.

## Trigger

The first trigger implementation is intentionally simple:

```ini
trigger.enabled=false
trigger.pixel_threshold_pe=5
trigger.camera_multiplicity=3
trigger.array_multiplicity=2
trigger.coincidence_window_ns=50
```

Camera trigger counts pixels above threshold in one telescope image. Array
trigger counts triggered telescopes for the same `event_id`. Neighbor topology,
waveform thresholding, and hardware-specific trigger logic are reserved for the
future electronics implementation.

If HDF5 output sets:

```ini
output.save_only_triggered=true
```

then `/images/index` and `/images/dense/*` keep only telescope images that pass
the camera trigger. The trigger decision tables still keep the evaluated
telescope and array trigger rows, so excluded telescope images can be audited
without storing their full 1616-pixel vectors.
